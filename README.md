# Calculator

A simple, responsive calculator built using HTML, CSS Grid, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Keyboard support with event listeners for key presses.
- Custom expression evaluation without using `eval()`.
- Responsive button grid for easy customization of button sizes.
- Calculator display shows the current input and result.
- Clear (`C`) and backspace (`←`) functionality.
- Styled with modern UI and smooth hover effects.
- Full height layout within a fixed container.

## File Structure

- `index.html` — Main HTML structure.
- `style.css` — Stylesheet for layout and design.
- `index.js` — JavaScript logic for calculator operations and event handling.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.
2. Use mouse clicks or keyboard input to perform calculations.
3. Use `C` to clear the display.
4. Use `←` to delete the last character.
5. Press `=` or `Enter` to evaluate the expression.

## Development

The calculator uses a simple parser and switch-case logic to evaluate expressions safely without using `eval()`. The layout uses CSS Grid to arrange buttons, allowing easy customization.
